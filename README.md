# Fraud-Detection-using-Genetic-Algorithm-
The model detects fraud by applying Genetic Algorithm to optimize feature selection and classification. It evolves solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation to identify fraudulent patterns in transaction data.
# Fraud Detection with Genetic Algorithm

This project applies Genetic Algorithms (GA) for fraud detection by optimizing feature selection and classification models to identify fraudulent transactions.

## Features

- **Fraud Detection:** Classifies transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:** Uses GA to select the most relevant features and optimize model performance.

## How it works

1. **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess transaction data.
2. **Feature Selection:** Apply Genetic Algorithm to find optimal feature subsets.
3. **Model Training:** Train a classifier (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, or others) using selected features.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate model accuracy and fraud detection performance.

## Genetic Algorithm Overview

- **Population Initialization:** Random feature subsets.
- **Fitness Function:** Model accuracy (or other metrics).
- **Selection, Crossover, Mutation:** Evolve better feature combinations over generations.:
